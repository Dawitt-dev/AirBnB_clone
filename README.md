# AirBnB Clone - The Console

The **AirBnB Clone - The Console** project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with Airbnb data. It allows users to manage their Airbnb listings, bookings, and reservations directly from the terminal.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Create, read, update, and delete Airbnb listings
- Search for listings by location, price, availability, and more
- View and manage bookings and reservations
- Generate reports and statistics on listings and bookings

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Create a designated repository on the remote server and clone it locally using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://access_token@github.com/name_of_author_on_github/Airbandb.git
   ```

2. **Work with the Files**: Start working with the provided files, such as `console.py`.

## Usage

The **AirBnB Clone - The Console** operates in two modes:

1. **Interactive Mode**: The console provides a prompt similar to a shell for user interaction.
   ```
   ./console.py
   (hbnb) help
   ```

2. **Non-Interactive Mode**: Run the shell with a command input piped into its execution. No prompt will appear, and no further input is expected from the user.
   ```
   $ echo "help" | ./console.py
   (hbnb) help
   ```

Feel free to explore and manage your Airbnb data using this simple and intuitive CLI!
